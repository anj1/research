Historically, CC has been used with Gaussian-type or Slater-type orbitals. In this work we set out to investigate if the use of CC with a Neural Network ansatz could offer improvements in accuracy without requiring excessively large bases.</p>
<p>For the specific neural network ansatz to use, we evaluate FermiNet [], a model that has been shown (in the VMC framework) to be able to compute accurate ground state wavefunctions. We also evaluate an attention-based ansatz.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="ferminet">
  FermiNet
  <a class="anchor" href="#ferminet">#</a>
</h2>
<p>FermiNet [] is an explicitly antisymmetrized multi-layer neural network wavefunction defined on a fixed number of electrons, with an architecture which we will briefly describe. We first consider a simplified version of FermiNet that ignores both spin and electron pair correlations, which we call FermiNet-S1. Define a set of multi-electron functions $\varphi_i^k(\mathbf{x}_j;\mathbf{x}_1,\dots,\mathbf{x}_{j-1},\mathbf{x}_{j+1},\dots,\mathbf{x}_n) = \varphi_i^k(\mathbf{x}_j;{\mathbf{x}_{/j}})$ where ${\mathbf{x}_{/j}}$ is the unordered set of all electron states except $\mathbf{x}_j$, and $i,j\in1,\dots,n$, the number of electrons. Define the following generalized Slater determinants:
$$
\psi^k(\mathbf{x}_1,\dots,\mathbf{x}_n) = \mathrm{det}\begin{bmatrix}
\varphi_1^k(\mathbf{x_1}) &amp; \dots &amp; \varphi_1^k(\mathbf{x}_n) \\
\vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots \\
\varphi_n^k(\mathbf{x_1}) &amp; \dots &amp; \varphi_n^k(\mathbf{x}_n)
\end{bmatrix} \tag{1}
$$</p>
<p>For ease of notation we have written $\varphi_i^k(\mathbf{x}_j;{\mathbf{x}_{/j}})$ as just $\varphi_i^k(\mathbf{x}_j)$. These functions are themselves defined as multi-layer feedforward networks.</p>
<p>The final (complex-valued) amplitude is a linear combination of these determinants:</p>
<p>$$
\Psi = \sum_{k=1}^\chi \omega_k \psi^k
$$</p>
<p>We may write the full wavefunction defined by FermiNet-S1 as:</p>
<p>$$
|\Psi\rangle = \int_{\mathbb{R}^{3N}} \Psi(\mathbf{x}_1,\dots,\mathbf{x}_n)|\mathbf{x}_1,\dots,\mathbf{x}_n \rangle \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}
$$</p>
<p>We perform the variational minimization over the parameters of the networks and ${\omega_k}$. This defines a mapping from the electron position state space to amplitudes.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="coupled-cluster-formulation">
  Coupled Cluster Formulation
  <a class="anchor" href="#coupled-cluster-formulation">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The coupled cluster wavefunction is given as:</p>
<p>$$
|\Psi_\mathrm{CC}\rangle=\exp(\hat{T})|\Psi\rangle
$$</p>
<p>With the <em>cluster operator</em> $\hat{T}$ given as:</p>
<p>$$
\hat{T} = \hat{T}_1 + \hat{T}_2 + \dots + \hat{T}_\mu
$$</p>
<p>Where each $\hat{T}_m$ represents $m$-level excitations. here, $\mu$ is the order of the coupled cluster operator. A common choice is $\mu=2$, in which case we obtain the version of CC that takes single- and double-excitations into account, called Coupled Cluster Singles Doubles (CCSD). It can be shown that for two-electron systems, CCSD can provide an <em>exact</em> solution. For (N&gt;2)-electron systems, CCSD is not exact, nevertheless in practice it usually provides a very good approximation to the electronic ground state. We can define the cluster operator explicitly in the second-quantization formulation, following [], as follows. For the single-excitation term,
$$
\hat{T}_1 = \sum_\alpha^\mathrm{occ}\sum_\rho^\mathrm{vir}t_\alpha^\rho \hat{a}_\rho^\dagger \hat{a}_\alpha
$$</p>
<p>With $\hat{a}_\rho^\dagger$ and $\hat{a}_\alpha$ being the fermionic creation and annihilation operators, respectively. $\mathrm{occ}$ represents the set of ground-state-occupied (hole) states, and $\mathrm{vir}$ represents the set of unoccupied (electron) states. The coefficients $t_\alpha^\rho$ are parameters to be determined.</p>
<p>For the double-excitation term,
$$
\hat{T}_2 = \frac{1}{4}\sum_{\alpha,\beta}^\mathrm{occ}\sum_{\rho,\sigma}^\mathrm{vir}t_{\alpha\beta}^{\rho\sigma} \hat{a}_\rho^\dagger \hat{a}_\sigma^\dagger \hat{a}_\beta \hat{a}_\alpha
$$</p>
<p>Thus we see that the excitation terms represent operators that pull electrons out of ground states and place them in excited states, while keeping the total number of electrons constant.</p>
<p>For CCSD, the full operator is then:
$$
\exp(\hat{T}) = \hat{1} + \hat{T}_1 + \hat{T}_2 + \frac{1}{2}\hat{T}_1^2 + \hat{T}_1\hat{T}_2 + \frac{1}{6}\hat{T}_1^3 + \frac{1}{2}\hat{T}_2^2 + \dots
$$</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="coupled-cluster-ferminet">
  Coupled Cluster FermiNet
  <a class="anchor" href="#coupled-cluster-ferminet">#</a>
</h3>
<p>We wish to apply this cluster operator to FermiNet. To do so, we must express it in the second quantized formulation and give meaning to the creation and annihilation operators. There are a few things to note. First, in fermionic second quantization, it is common to choose a fixed set of (antisymmetric) basis states, then rewrite the wavefunction in this basis. When the wavefunction is a slater determinant of orthogonal single-particle orbitals, it is common to choose the orbitals themselves as a basis. However, here, the orbitals are neither orthogonal nor fixed (as the parameters of the network can vary), complicating the use of this basis state. Second, FermiNet is defined for a fixed number of electrons, however creation (annihilation) operators increase (decrease) the number of electrons. We address both of these issues separately.</p>
<h4 class="heading" id="particle-number">
  Particle Number
  <a class="anchor" href="#particle-number">#</a>
</h4>
<p>To represent FermiNet in second quantization where operators are typically allowed to change particle numbers, one option is to define an extension to the architecture where the number of input electrons is not fixed. Alternatively, and more simply, we can make use of the fact that our cluster operator only has terms of the form e.g. $\hat{a}_\rho^\dagger \hat{a}_\alpha$ that keep the total number of particles constant. Thus we only need to define the action of these particle number-preserving operators on the network.</p>
<p>Define the operators $\hat{a}_\rho^\dagger \hat{a}_\alpha$ as follows, based on their action on the individual slater determinants $\psi^k$:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{a}_\rho^\dagger \hat{a}_\alpha |\psi^k\rangle &amp;= \hat{a}_\rho^\dagger \hat{a}_\alpha \sum_{\mathbf{x}_1,\dots,\mathbf{x}_n} \psi^k(\mathbf{x}_1,\dots,\mathbf{x}_n)|\mathbf{x}_1,\dots,\mathbf{x}_n \rangle \\
&amp;= \hat{a}_\rho^\dagger \hat{a}_\alpha \sum_{\mathbf{x}_1,\dots,\mathbf{x}_n} \mathrm{det}\begin{bmatrix}
\varphi_1^k(\mathbf{x_1}) &amp; \dots &amp; \varphi_1^k(\mathbf{x}_n) \\
\vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots \\
\varphi_
\alpha^k(\mathbf{x_1}) &amp; \dots &amp; \varphi_\alpha^k(\mathbf{x}_n) \\
\vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots \\
\varphi_n^k(\mathbf{x_1}) &amp; \dots &amp; \varphi_n^k(\mathbf{x}_n)
\end{bmatrix}|\mathbf{x}_1,\dots,\mathbf{x}_n \rangle \\
\\
&amp;= \sum_{\mathbf{x}_1,\dots,\mathbf{x}_n} \mathrm{det}\begin{bmatrix}
\varphi_1^k(\mathbf{x_1}) &amp; \dots &amp; \varphi_1^k(\mathbf{x}_n) \\
\vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots \\
\varphi_
\rho^k(\mathbf{x_1}) &amp; \dots &amp; \varphi_\rho^k(\mathbf{x}_n) \\
\vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots \\
\varphi_n^k(\mathbf{x_1}) &amp; \dots &amp; \varphi_n^k(\mathbf{x}_n)
\end{bmatrix}|\mathbf{x}_1,\dots,\mathbf{x}_n \rangle \\
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>In other words, the action of such an operator is to remove the orbital function $\varphi_{i=\alpha}^k$ (represented by the corresponding row in the determinant) and replace it with a new orbital $\varphi_\rho^k$, while keeping the number of electrons (columns) constant.</p>
<p>Where does this new orbital come from? In the standard FermiNet, for each SD $k$, the number of orbitals is fixed and equal to the number of electrons. In this work, we extend this architecture to allow a number of <em>occupied</em> and <em>virtual</em> orbitals, but where only a subset of these orbitals at any time are used in the slater determinant calculation. The subset is always of size $n$. We call this architecture FermiNet-2Q(-S1). We write the new SDs as:
$$
\hat{\psi}^k(\mathbf{x}_1,\dots,\mathbf{x}_n;\pi_1,\dots,\pi_n) = \mathrm{det}\begin{bmatrix}
\varphi_{\pi_1}^k(\mathbf{x_1}) &amp; \dots &amp; \varphi_{\pi_1}^k(\mathbf{x}_n) \\
\vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots \\
\varphi_{\pi_n}^k(\mathbf{x_1}) &amp; \dots &amp; \varphi_{\pi_n}^k(\mathbf{x}_n)
\end{bmatrix}\tag{2}
$$</p>
<p>With the new variables $\pi_{i\in1,\dots,n} \in 1,\dots,\nu$ representing a selection of orbitals, and $\nu = |\mathrm{occ}|+|\mathrm{vir}|$. Note that FermiNet is simply a special case of FermiNet-2Q where we set $\pi_i=i$. Another way of looking at it is that FermiNet describes the Fermi vacuum state of FermiNet-2Q.</p>
<p>We can trivially satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations by simply defining $\hat{a}_\alpha\hat{a}_\rho^\dagger = -\hat{a}_\rho^\dagger \hat{a}_\alpha$. That is, swapping the order of the operators performs the same row substitution, just with a negated sign on the determinant. We can also define $\hat{a}_\alpha\hat{a}_\alpha^\dagger = 1$. It is important to note that in our formulation we are <em>not</em> defining the individual operators $\hat{a}_\alpha^\dagger$ or $\hat{a}_\alpha$, thus this implicit anticommutation still results in well-defined operators.</p>
<p>We can write out the operators $\hat{a}_\rho^\dagger \hat{a}_\sigma^\dagger \hat{a}_\beta \hat{a}_\alpha$ in a similar way, as removing orbitals $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and replacing them with orbitals $\sigma$ and $\rho$ in the corresponding rows. For sake of brevity we omit the explicit representation here, however refer to the appendix for a complete derivation.</p>
<p>Returning to (2), it may seem unnatural, at first glance, to include discrete variables as parameters in a neural network, even as non-learned parameters (as they are here). However, this is in fact standard, in the form of the <em>dropout</em> procedure that is often used during neural network training []. For a rough analogy: In dropout, the activations of randomly selected neurons are simply dropped (&rsquo;turned off&rsquo;) at random while doing gradient descent iterations. In the quantum analog described here, one can picture a subset of neurons being &lsquo;on&rsquo; and another subset being &lsquo;off&rsquo;, and then considering all possible single-neuron &rsquo;excitations&rsquo; (which turn a normally-on neuron off and a normally off-neuron on), and also all possible double-neuron excitations.</p>
<h4 class="heading" id="non-orthogonal-orbitals">
  Non-orthogonal Orbitals
  <a class="anchor" href="#non-orthogonal-orbitals">#</a>
</h4>
<p>We now turn our attention to the second problem, which is that in the standard formulation of FermiNet, the orbitals $\varphi_i^k$ are not fixed and not (typically) orthogonal. To address this, we take inspiration from a technique recently proposed in (Entwistle 2022) for PauliNet (), where an overlap term (representing non-orthogonality of the orbitals) is added to the neural network loss:
$$
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{overlap}(\mathbf{\theta}) = \sum_{i&gt;j} \left(\frac{1}{1-|S_{ij}|} - 1\right)
$$</p>
<p>Where:
$$
S_{ij} = \mathrm{sgn} \left(\mathbb{E}_i \left[\frac{\Psi_{\theta,j}(\mathbb{r})}{\Psi_{\theta,i}(\mathbb{r})} \right] \right) \times \sqrt{\mathbb{E}_i \left[\frac{\Psi_{\theta,j}(\mathbb{r})}{\Psi_{\theta,i}(\mathbb{r})} \right] \mathbb{E}_j \left[\frac{\Psi_{\theta,i}(\mathbb{r})}{\Psi_{\theta,j}(\mathbb{r})} \right]}
$$</p>
<p>See (Entwistle 2022) for details. The total loss is then:
$$
\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{\theta}) = \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{energy}(\mathbf{\theta}) + \alpha \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{overlap}(\mathbf{\theta})
$$</p>
<p>The parameter $\alpha$ can be tuned during training. It is set to a small value at the start of training to ensure finding low-energy states, and then gradually increased to make those states orthogonal.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="ccsd-hamiltonian">
  CCSD Hamiltonian
  <a class="anchor" href="#ccsd-hamiltonian">#</a>
</h3>
<p>With FermiNet-2Q and the corresponding operators defined, we turn to the Hamiltonian, which we write in the second quantized form. The second quantized Hamiltonian is usually written as:
$$
\hat{H} = \sum_{\rho, \alpha} s_\alpha^\rho \hat{a}_\rho^\dagger \hat{a}_\alpha + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\alpha,\beta,\rho,\sigma}P_{\alpha\beta}^{\rho\sigma} \hat{a}_\rho^\dagger \hat{a}_\sigma^\dagger \hat{a}_\beta \hat{a}_\alpha
$$</p>
<p>Note the similarity of these terms to the single- and double-excitation operators, with the difference here being that $s$ and $P$ are determined:
$$
s_\alpha^\rho = \int \psi_\rho^*(\mathbf{x}) \left( -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) \right) \psi_\alpha(\mathbf{x}) , d\mathbf{x}
$$</p>
<p>$$
P_{\alpha\beta}^{\rho\sigma} = \int \int \psi_\rho^*(\mathbf{x}_1) \psi_\sigma^*(\mathbf{x}_2) V(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2) \psi_\beta(\mathbf{x}_2) \psi_\alpha(\mathbf{x}_1) , d\mathbf{x}_1 , d\mathbf{x}_2
$$</p>
<p>Where $V(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2)$ is the interaction potential between electrons at positions $\mathbf{x}_1$ and $\mathbf{x}_2$.</p>
